# Panoptranscription
 A transcription tool for video lectures to export them as LaTeX notes using the ChatGPT API

# How to use
 This is a walkthrough of a general use-case:
 1) If you haven't already, download a browser extension to download videoes, I recommend using [Video Downloader Pro](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/video-downloader-professi/elicpjhcidhpjomhibiffojpinpmmpil?hl=en).
 2) Use the browser extension to download the video, or download it by other means.
 3) Open Panoptranscription and input your [ChatGPT API Token](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) if this is your first time using the program.
 4) Choose the video path.
 5) Choose whether to translate the notes to english or not.
 6) Click the Transcribe Button and wait for it to finish
 7) You will now have a .tex file in the output folder.
