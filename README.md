# Dependencies
 1) [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and add to PATH or install via ```windows_install.bat```
 2) (Optional) CUDA for Nvidia Graphics Cards Acceleration when transcribing, recommended

# How to use
 This is a rough walkthrough of the first use of the program: 
 1) Download and install all dependencies via ```windows_install.bat```
 2) If you haven't already, download a browser extension to download videoes, I recommend using [Video Downloader Pro](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/video-downloader-professi/elicpjhcidhpjomhibiffojpinpmmpil?hl=en).
 3) Use the browser extension to download the video, or download it by other means.
 4) Open Panoptranscription and input your [ChatGPT API Token](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) if this is your first time using the program.
 5) Choose the video path.
 6) Choose what language the video is in.
 7) Choose what model to use for transcription.
 8) Click the Start Button and wait for it to finish
 9) You will now have a .tex file in the output folder.
